- sakuragi: グス　てめーら
```

1. グス (gusu):
グス is an onomatopoeic sound in Japanese that often represents the sound of sniffling or sobbing, usually when someone is crying or holding back tears.
It's typically used in manga and anime to convey that a character is emotionally distressed or crying, even if no words are spoken.
It can be translated as "sniff" or "sob" in English, but it's often left untranslated to retain the sound effect.
2. てめーら (temēra):
てめーら is a casual and very rude or rough way of saying "you guys" or "you all."
てめー (temē) is a highly informal and often aggressive way to say "you." It’s much stronger than the standard あなた (anata) or even お前 (omae).
ら (ra) is a pluralizing suffix, so てめーら refers to a group of people, often with a hostile or confrontational tone.
It’s something you might hear in a heated argument or a tough, rebellious character addressing others in a manga.
