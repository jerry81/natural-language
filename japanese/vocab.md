- what does から mean?

- "から" is a Japanese particle that is often used to indicate the starting point of an action, reason, or cause. It's commonly translated as "because," "from," or "since" in English.
Example: "学校から帰りました" (Gakkou kara kaerimashita) means "I came back from school."
Example: "雨が降っているから、傘を持ってきました" (Ame ga futteiru kara, kasa o mottekimashita) means "Because it's raining, I brought an umbrella."

- what is きました?

- "きました" is the past tense form of the verb "来る" (kuru), which means "to come."
It's used to describe an action that someone has completed, specifically the action of coming to a certain place.
Example: "友達が家に来ました" (Tomodachi ga ie ni kimashita) means "My friend came to my house."
Example: "今日、東京に着きました" (Kyou, Tokyo ni tsukimashita) means "Today, I arrived in Tokyo."

ChatGPT
The character "着" (ki) in the example "今日、東京に着きました" (Kyou, Tokyo ni tsukimashita) serves as a suffix to the verb "着く" (tsuku), which means "to arrive." In this context, it indicates the completion of an action, specifically the action of arriving at a destination.

So, "着きました" (tsukimashita) means "arrived" or "came." The sentence "今日、東京に着きました" translates to "Today, I arrived in Tokyo." The character "に" (ni) indicates the destination ("in Tokyo").
