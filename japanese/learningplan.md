Sure! Here's a Japanese learning plan for absolute beginners:

Start with Hiragana and Katakana:

Begin by learning the basic hiragana and katakana characters, which are the two essential phonetic scripts in Japanese. Familiarize yourself with their shapes, sounds, and stroke orders. There are various online resources and mobile apps available for learning hiragana and katakana, such as flashcards, practice sheets, and interactive exercises.
Learn Basic Vocabulary and Grammar:

Start building your vocabulary by learning common words and phrases. Begin with simple, everyday words and gradually expand your knowledge. Use resources like textbooks, online courses, or mobile apps that provide vocabulary lists and example sentences.
Concurrently, learn basic grammar structures, such as sentence patterns and verb conjugations. Understand the basics of word order and sentence structure in Japanese. Study beginner-level grammar explanations and practice using them in simple sentences.
Practice Listening and Speaking:

Listen to Japanese audio materials, such as podcasts, music, or language learning resources. Focus on developing your listening skills and getting used to the sounds and rhythms of the language.
Practice speaking aloud to improve your pronunciation and fluency. Repeat after audio materials or practice with language exchange partners or tutors who can provide feedback and guidance.
Expand Kanji Knowledge:

Begin learning kanji characters gradually. Start with commonly used kanji and their basic meanings. Study stroke order, radicals, and readings associated with each kanji. Practice writing kanji to reinforce your memory.
As you progress, learn kanji in context by studying vocabulary words and sentences that contain the kanji. Gradually increase your kanji knowledge over time.
Practice Reading and Writing:

Read simple texts in Japanese, such as children's books, graded readers, or beginner-level articles. Start with materials that include furigana (small hiragana or katakana characters) above the kanji to aid in reading comprehension.
Practice writing in Japanese by keeping a journal, writing short essays, or participating in language exchange activities. Focus on using the grammar, vocabulary, and kanji you've learned.
Language Exchange and Cultural Immersion:

Engage in language exchange activities with native Japanese speakers or fellow learners. Practice speaking and writing Japanese with others, and learn from their feedback.
Immerse yourself in Japanese culture through movies, TV shows, music, and online content. This exposure will enhance your understanding of the language and provide cultural context.
Consistent Practice and Review:

Dedicate regular study time and establish a study routine to maintain consistency in your learning.
Continuously review previous lessons, vocabulary, grammar, and characters to reinforce your knowledge and ensure retention.
Remember that learning a language requires time, patience, and regular practice. Adjust the pace of your learning according to your comfort level, and gradually challenge yourself as you progress. Supplement your studies with resources that suit your learning style and goals, such as textbooks, online courses, language exchange platforms, and mobile apps. Enjoy the journey and celebrate your progress along the way!
