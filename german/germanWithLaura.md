## classic pitfalls

- don't learn like children - starting with vocabulary.
  - children learn with instant immersion
  - not good at beginning for us (children take years)
- german != english
  - there are word endings not found in english "declensions"
  - e.g.
    - Die
    - nette
    - diesem
    - hungrigen
    - einen
- don't start with vocabulary
  - pitfall because of the declensions
  - e.g. Die -> "the", but 6 words translate to "the"
    - die
    - den
    - der
    - dem
    - das
    - des
  - grammar holds vocab together
  - will be forced to stop if only learning vocab without grammar
