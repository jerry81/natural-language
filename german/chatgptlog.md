What does ihnen mean?
ChatGPT
"Ihnen" is a pronoun in German that translates to "you" in English. However, it specifically refers to the formal "you" (second person plural) and is used when addressing someone in a polite or formal context. It is the dative case form of "Sie," which is the formal pronoun for "you" in German.

For example, in the phrase "Wie geht es Ihnen?" (How are you?), "Ihnen" is used to address someone formally or politely. In this case, "Ihnen" functions as the dative form of "Sie."

It's important to note that in German, the pronoun "Sie" (formal "you") and its related forms like "Ihnen" are capitalized to distinguish them from the pronoun "sie" (she/they) and the possessive pronoun "ihr" (her/their).
