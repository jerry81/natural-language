are Möchten and magen related?
ChatGPT
Yes, "möchten" and "mögen" are related in German, but they have different meanings and usage.

"Möchten" is the conditional form of the verb "mögen" and is used to express a polite request or desire. For example, "Ich möchte eine Tasse Kaffee" means "I would like a cup of coffee."

On the other hand, "mögen" means "to like." It is used to express preferences or positive feelings towards something or someone. For example, "Ich mag Schokolade" means "I like chocolate."

While the two words share a common root, their meanings and usage have diverged in modern German.
