# 48 laws of power
- Robert Greene

## law 13 - appeal to self-interest, not mercy
- story 1
- Castruccio Castracani
  - 14th century = 1300 - 1400
  - italian - common soldier to ruler of city
- poggios - family that helped him rise to power
  - felt shunned
- war between CC and P
  - a peaceful poggio intervenes
  - asked CC for mercy - oops
  - CC agreed, invited P family to discuss
  - executed them all

- equates appealing to justice and gratitude with mercy

- story 2
- 483 BC, peloponnesian War
  - greek empire vs spartans
- Corinth(Greek), island of Corfu/Corcyra battle imminent
- ambassadors meeting, vying for Athens' favor
- Corfu had no previous ties, coming in with blank slate.
  - offered strong navy
- corinth ambassador spoke of laurels - oops
- athens sides with corfu

- reminding of laurels irritates - guilt trip and manipulation

- pragmatic people focus on present and future and deprioritize the past

- applies to situation of asking more powerful people for help

- story 3
- Japanese foreign relations in 16th century
- portuguese tried to spread religion
- dutch shared scientific/militaristic knowhow
- portugese kicked out

- universal and timeless concern: self-interest

- story 4
- mongols invading china, 12th century
- gengis khan only spared chinese cities from destruction after someone advised him that he could tax and use the talent

- reversal
- some people like giving mercy and charity to feel superior
- read your mark: greedy->self-interest
- want to appear noble -> charity
