# 48 laws of power

- Robert Greene

## law 13 - appeal to self-interest, not mercy

- story 1
- Castruccio Castracani
  - 14th century = 1300 - 1400
  - italian - common soldier to ruler of city
- poggios - family that helped him rise to power
  - felt shunned
- war between CC and P

  - a peaceful poggio intervenes
  - asked CC for mercy - oops
  - CC agreed, invited P family to discuss
  - executed them all

- equates appealing to justice and gratitude with mercy

- story 2
- 483 BC, peloponnesian War
  - greek empire vs spartans
- Corinth(Greek), island of Corfu/Corcyra battle imminent
- ambassadors meeting, vying for Athens' favor
- Corfu had no previous ties, coming in with blank slate.
  - offered strong navy
- corinth ambassador spoke of laurels - oops
- athens sides with corfu

- reminding of laurels irritates - guilt trip and manipulation

- pragmatic people focus on present and future and deprioritize the past

- applies to situation of asking more powerful people for help

- story 3
- Japanese foreign relations in 16th century
- portuguese tried to spread religion
- dutch shared scientific/militaristic knowhow
- portugese kicked out

- universal and timeless concern: self-interest

- story 4
- mongols invading china, 12th century
- gengis khan only spared chinese cities from destruction after someone advised him that he could tax and use the talent

- reversal
- some people like giving mercy and charity to feel superior
- read your mark: greedy->self-interest
- want to appear noble -> charity

## law 14 pose as a frield work as a spy

- Story 1
- Joseph Duveen - Art dealer
- Andrew Mellon (industrialist) wouldn't buy from him.
- be friendly to gather info

- Tallyrand (again)
- did not speak much
- people told him lots

- caveats:
- don't be too obvious, worming too much info (especially critical) will turn them away
- stick to friendly convo
- probing questions reveal too much about yourself

- Reversal: careful, enemy may feed lies

## law 15 Crush your enemy completely

- Story 1
- Xiangyu and LIubang 3 kingdoms
- Xiangyu captured liubang, showed mercy
- liubang kills xiang in the end.
- this chapter bores me

## law 16 - Use absense to increase respect and honor

- create value through scarcity
- too much circulation lowers the price

- story: Guillaume de Balaum
  - troubadour
  - south france
  - some relationship with a lady
  - his absence  made her love him more.

- laws of absence and presence
- at first your presence is needed to establish yourself
- do not be absent too early, or you may be forgotten
- being absent for no reason stokes excitement even more
- absence -> garners respect
- presence -> garners disdain

- story 2
  - a new city state, medea (northern iran)
  - a man rises to power - Deioces
  - does good work as a judge
  - suddenly retires from that work
  - people beg him to become king

- quotable:
Love never dies of starvation, but often dies of indigeston

- people respect you after you die
- create a death before death

- Econ: law of scarcity
- by withdrawing something from the market, you create instant value for it
- dutch made tulips hard to obtain and created tulipmania

- application: get skills that are rare

- reversal/caveat: only applies when you have established yourself somewhat

## law 17 - be unpredictable and keep your opponents in suspense and in terror

- story 1 - bobby fischer, boris spaasky

- sudden and unpredictable is the most terrifying thing
- earthquakes and tornadoes
- animals set in their patterns
- humans can alter

- Mini Story 2 - fillipo Maria - Milan duke, 1400s
